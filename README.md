# Implement-Traffic-Management

We are tasked with testing managing network traffic targeting Azure virtual machines in the hub and spoke network topology, which Contoso considers implementing in its Azure environment (instead of creating the mesh topology, which you tested in the previous lab). This testing needs to include implementing connectivity between spokes by relying on user defined routes that force traffic to flow via the hub, as well as traffic distribution across virtual machines by using layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers. For this purpose, you intend to use Azure Load Balancer (layer 4) and Azure Application Gateway (layer 7).


Task 1: Configure the hub and spoke network topology

Task 2: Test transitivity of virtual network peering

Task 3: Configure routing in the hub and spoke topology

Task 4: Implement Azure Load Balancer

Task 5: Implement Azure Application Gateway
